<big>Our weekly Friday meetups are called Friday Hacks. They include one or two technical talks, followed by a hacking session. The idea is simple: get people to come share their hacks, research, or technical knowledge with the technical community in NUS.</big>

We have up to 2 talks at each session, talks are usually 30-45 minutes long. Dinner is always served (usually pizza). Food is served at 6:30pm, talks start at 7pm.

<strong>How do I get there from outside campus/Where can I park?</strong><br>
The closest MRT station is at Clementi. Take either the 96 from the bus interchange (which is at Clementi mall) towards Singapore Polytechnic, and get off 3 bus stops later. (You may also take bus 183 from the MRT station, but bus frequency for 183 is low). As for parking: you may park at a small parking lot at UTown opposite New Town Secondary School, along Dover road.

<strong>Who is welcome to speak?</strong><br>
Anyone! We do give some preference to NUS students, staff and professors, but we regularly invite speakers from all parts of the industry.

<strong>Who has given a Friday Hacks talk?</strong><br>
We've had speakers from Google, Quora, Palantir, Thought Works, Pivotal Labs, Nokia, RIM,  and Viki, amongst many others.

<strong>What time should speakers arrive?</strong><br>
People start streaming in at 6pm, but Friday Hacks are informal, so anytime between 6pm-7pm is okay. The actual event starts at 7pm.

<strong>What topic should I talk about?</strong><br>
Technical topics, of course! Talking about a weekend hack project, your research, or some ideas you recently had about tech are all great topics for a Friday Hacks talk. <em>The more code you show, the better!</em> Note though that you should <strong>not</strong> give a recruiting pitch. Focus on the technology, and you'll find that people will be more receptive to any pitch you may give at the tail end of your talk.

<strong>What's the audience like?</strong><br>
Anyone is welcomed to attend Friday Hacks, though the audience would be primarily NUS School of Computing students. From experience, we expect 30-50 students on average at every weekly meeting.

<strong>What tools are provided?</strong><br>
We have a Windows desktop, a projector with VGA and adapters from Mini-DisplayPort, a large whiteboard, and wireless network access. Let us know in your email if you need anything else and we'll see what we can do.
